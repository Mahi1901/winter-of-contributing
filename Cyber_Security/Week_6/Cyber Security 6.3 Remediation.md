# REMEDIATION IN VAPT

Remediation is a process, which is basically used to replace some kind of mistakes and set it right.
Mostly, presence of vulnerabilty in some areas indicate weekness in practice for development which could also have repilcated similar vulnerability in different locations and thus, it is important to carefully investigate and test the entity with eneffective security controls and due to this reason, oraganisations or companies should take respective measurement to remediate any kind of vulnerabilty within the time limit.

Remediation efforts extends for longer period after initial penetration testing and a new test engagement ensures accuracy of the results.

Vapt remediation process is a workflow which fixes detected weaknesses and issues.

Now, there're four steps for remediation process:<br>

## 1.Find:
It detects the vulnerabilities through scanning and testing.And it also uses devsecops approach and tools to automate vulnerabilties, and these tools are deployed in development, testing, and production environment.
<br>
## 2.Prioritize:
vulnerabilities are prioritized in number of ways:
-vulnerability information
-risk based priority scoring
-application level insight
-deep control of security policies
<br>


## 3.Fix:
This step fixes the vulnerabilities.<br>
There may be less risky ways to fix a weakness, or to at least buy time while a patch is being prepared for deployments. <br>


## 4.Monitor:

This process monitors vulnerabilities and also  provides contextualized prioritization in remediation process.
<br>
Now while monitoring, in any kind of disperencies or any other thing, following process can happen:
<br>
-immediate lockdown<br>
-enhanced navigation<br>
-patches
